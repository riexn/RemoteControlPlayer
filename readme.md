# TODO
videos that were finished playing will have a `*played*` marking

videos that were deleted will have `*played*` and `*invalid*` markings

so check for files that failed to play
we need to check if it has `*played*` and `*invalid*` to remove it from the list

FIX the code of it assuming `*played*` is invalid so it doesn't cause issues  :)
